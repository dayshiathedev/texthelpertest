# Text Helper

This is a simple Python text helper script that analyzes a piece of text.

## Features

- Counts total characters in the text
- Counts total words
- Calculates full 200-character pages using floor division (`//`)
- Shows remaining characters on the last page using remainder (`%`)
- Calculates full 10-word lines and leftover words
- Converts the text to uppercase
- Replaces a word in the text to show basic string manipulation

## Example

Given this text in `text_helper.py`:

```python
text = "Hello, this is my first text helper test."
